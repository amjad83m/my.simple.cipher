JavaScript Module - Week 2 Assignment - An implementation of a simple shifting cipher 

In this page, I'm implementing a simple shifting algorithm to achieve some sort of a text encryption tool.
I'm using the Caesar Cipher algorithm but instead of a shifting of 3 characters I used 6. So each letter in the original
text will be replaced by the letter that is 6 places ahead. All numbers and punctuation marks are ignored in this version.
Capitalization also doesn't count in the resulting encrypted text.

## Usage
1. To encrypt a text, use the first text area. Enter the text and click the "Encrypt" button. The original text is encrypted
and displayed in the same text area.
2. To decrypt a text, use the second text area. Enter the "encrypted" text and click the "Decrypt" button. The encrypted text
is converted back to its original state and displayed in the same text area.

## History
This is the initial version. No modifications made yet.

## Future Possible Updates
1. Implementing an encryption key entered by the user.
2. Using multiple encryption algorithms.
3. Improvements to the UI.

## Live Version
